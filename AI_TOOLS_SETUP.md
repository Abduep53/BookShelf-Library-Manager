# AI Tools Setup Guide

## Quick Start Guide for BookShelf AI Tools

This guide will help you set up and use the new AI-powered features in BookShelf.

---

## Prerequisites

- Django project already set up and running
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Internet connection for OpenAI API calls

---

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install Required Packages

Run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs:
- `openai>=1.0.0` - OpenAI Python client
- `python-dotenv>=1.0.0` - Environment variable loader

### 2. Get Your OpenAI API Key

1. **Sign up / Log in** to OpenAI:
   - Visit: https://platform.openai.com/signup
   - Create an account or log in with existing credentials

2. **Generate API Key**:
   - Navigate to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Click **"Create new secret key"**
   - Give it a name (e.g., "BookShelf AI Tools")
   - Copy the key (starts with `sk-...`)
   - **Important**: Save it securely - you won't be able to see it again!

3. **Check Billing** (if needed):
   - Go to: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
   - Add payment method if required
   - Note: GPT-3.5-turbo is very affordable (typically $0.001-0.002 per request)

### 3. Create `.env` File

**On Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\User\Desktop\cs50web finall"
New-Item -Path .env -ItemType File
notepad .env
```

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
cd ~/path/to/project
touch .env
nano .env
```

### 4. Add Your API Key to `.env`

Paste the following into your `.env` file:

```env
# OpenAI API Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
```

Replace `sk-your-actual-api-key-here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

**Save and close the file.**

### 5. Add `.env` to `.gitignore` (Important!)

Create or edit `.gitignore` in your project root:

```gitignore
# Environment variables
.env
*.env

# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
*.so
.Python
env/
venv/
ENV/
db.sqlite3

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo
```

### 6. Restart Django Server

Stop your Django server (Ctrl+C) and restart it:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The server needs to restart to load the environment variables from `.env`.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "OpenAI API key not configured"

**Solution**: 
- Ensure `.env` file exists in project root
- Verify the file contains: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
- Restart Django server after creating `.env`

### Error: "Invalid API key"

**Solution**:
- Check that you copied the entire API key (starts with `sk-`)
- Verify key is still active at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Ensure no extra spaces or quotes around the key in `.env`

### Error: Rate limit exceeded

**Solution**:
- OpenAI has rate limits based on your plan
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Consider upgrading your OpenAI plan if needed

### AI returns incomplete or weird responses

**Solution**:
- This is normal occasionally - AI responses can vary
- Try submitting the request again
- Adjust your input to be more specific or clear

### Modals not opening

**Solution**:
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors (F12)
- Ensure you're logged in (AI Tools requires authentication)
- Clear browser cache and reload

## Security Best Practices

‚úÖ **DO**:

- Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
- Never commit API keys to Git
- Rotate keys if accidentally exposed
- Monitor API usage regularly

‚ùå **DON'T**:
- Share your API key with others
- Commit `.env` to version control
- Expose API key in frontend JavaScript
- Use the same key for multiple projects (optional, but good practice)

---

## Customization

### Change AI Model

Edit `library/views.py` in the OpenAI API calls:

```python
# For better quality (more expensive)
model="gpt-4"

# Current default (cost-effective)
model="gpt-3.5-turbo"

# For even cheaper (lower quality)
model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0125"
```

### Adjust Response Length

Modify `max_tokens` parameter:

```python
max_tokens=150   # Shorter responses
max_tokens=500   # Medium length
max_tokens=1000  # Longer responses
```

### Customize System Prompts

Edit the `system` role content in API calls:

```python
{
    "role": "system",
    "content": "You are a literary expert specializing in classic novels..."
}
```
