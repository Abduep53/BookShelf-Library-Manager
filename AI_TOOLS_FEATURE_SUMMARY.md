## 🔐 Security Implementation

### ✅ Secure API Key Management
1. **Environment Variables**: API key stored in `.env` file
2. **Backend Only**: Key never exposed to frontend JavaScript
3. **Settings Integration**: Loaded via `python-dotenv`
4. **Git Protection**: `.env` already in `.gitignore`

### ✅ CSRF Protection
- All POST endpoints require CSRF tokens
- Frontend JavaScript includes CSRF token in headers
- Django's built-in protection enabled

### ✅ Authentication
- AI Tools page accessible to all (no login required for viewing)
- Could add `@login_required` decorator if needed

### ✅ Input Validation
- Backend validates all required fields
- Returns 400 errors for missing data
- Frontend HTML5 validation (required attributes)

### ✅ Error Handling
- Try-except blocks catch all exceptions
- User-friendly error messages
- No sensitive data in error responses

## 📊 Technical Details

### OpenAI API Configuration

| Feature | Model | Max Tokens | Temperature | Cost/Request |
|---------|-------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| Summarizer | gpt-3.5-turbo | 300 | 0.7 | ~$0.001-0.002 |
| Recommender | gpt-3.5-turbo | 800 | 0.8 | ~$0.002-0.003 |
| Quiz Generator | gpt-3.5-turbo | 1000 | 0.7 | ~$0.002-0.004 |

### Response Parsing
- **Primary**: Attempts JSON parsing
- **Fallback**: Text parsing with regex/splitting
- **Validation**: Ensures all required fields present
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation

### Frontend JavaScript
- **Fetch API**: Modern promise-based HTTP requests
- **CSRF Handling**: Cookie-based token extraction
- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamic result rendering
- **Event Handling**: Form submissions, modal events
- **Error Display**: Alert dialogs for failures
